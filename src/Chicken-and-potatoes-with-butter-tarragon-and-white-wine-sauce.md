Easy but seriously gourmet-tasting chicken with potatoes that are crispy on the outside but melt-in-your-mouth soft on the inside. Quite French

## Ingredients

- 1kg chicken wings
- 4 or 5 potatoes
- Runner beans/any long green thing you like
- Grapeseed oil
- 100g butter
- 8 cloves of garlic, crushed with something flat
- 1-2 tbsp tarragon
- Chilli powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- White wine
- Large pan for boiling potatoes
- Large frying pan with a lid

## Directions

1. Cut the potatoes into halves/thirds.
2. Boil with a tsp of baking soda and salt. Keep them boiling throughout and check on them occasionally until they are *very* soft.
3. In the meantime, fry chicken wings in lots of grapeseed oil.
4. Place chicken wings in a bowl on the side when they look cooked (after a few minutes).
5. Grind black pepper on the chicken wings and lightly dust with chilli powder.
6. Prepare a tablespoon or two of tarragon in a small bowl and grind some pepper into it.
7. Remove most of the oil from the pan and add butter.
8. Fry garlic for a minute on a high heat then add tarragon/pepper mix and add a fair amount of white wine.
9. Add the long green things, place the chicken on top of them, turn the heat right down and simmer for 10 minutes or so until the long green things turn soft.
10. Take out the chicken and long green things but keep the sauce in the frying pan.
11. Fry the potatoes in the sauce until they are crispy on the outside.
12. Serve.
